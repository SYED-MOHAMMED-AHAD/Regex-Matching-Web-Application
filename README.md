Description of the Regex Matching Web App Project
The Regex Matching Web App is a Python-based web application developed using the Flask framework, designed to replicate the core functionality of regex101.com.
This user-friendly application allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) pattern to find matches efficiently.

Key Features:
1) user Input: Users can enter any test string and regex pattern through an intuitive form.
2) Regex Matching: Upon submission, the app uses Python's re module to analyze the test string, extracting all matching segments based on the provided regex.
3) Results Display: Matched strings are dynamically displayed below the input fields, allowing users to quickly see the results of their regex queries.
4) Interactive Interface: The app provides a responsive and visually appealing user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

Development Process:
1) Project Setup: A new project directory is created, and Flask is installed to provide the web framework.
2) Application Initialization: The app.py file initializes the Flask application, defining routes for both the home page and result handling.
3) HTML Template Creation: The application includes an HTML template (index.html) where users can interact with the app.
4) Form Submission Handling: The app processes form submissions by extracting user input, performing regex operations, and rendering the results.

Summary:
This project serves as a practical demonstration of web development skills while providing a useful tool for anyone working with regular expressions,
Users can easily test and validate regex patterns, making it a valuable resource for developers, data analysts, and students alike.
